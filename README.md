# AV-Check

A script in python to check if a windows machine has an Antivirus Installed.  
I made this script when working on [tryhackme's room Intro to AV](https://tryhackme.com/room/introtoav)

## How to run
- You will need to have python installed in the machine.
- You can run with `python av-check.py`
